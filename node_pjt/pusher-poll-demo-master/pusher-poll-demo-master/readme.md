## Pusher Poll Demo

[View tutorial](https://pusher.com/tutorials/live-poll-nodejs/)

## Getting Started

The project is divided into two:

- Client
- Server

Feel free to clone the repository, cd into `server` and run:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Start
npm start
```

Make sure to provide your Pusher credentials via `env` variables

You can also start the Client using any HTTP server of your choice. I use `serve`:

```bash
serve --port 5000
```
